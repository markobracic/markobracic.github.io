    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nI am a behavioural biologist passionate about understanding how animals make decisions and exploring the ecological consequences of their behaviour. My work is interdisciplinary, incorporating cognition, ecology and evolution with empirical and theoretical approaches to uncover the miseries of animal behaviour.\nRecently, I finished my PhD at University of Münster, Department of Behavioural Biology at as a part of collaborative research center for a novel synthesis of individualisation (NC3) and a student in Münster Graduate School of Evolution (MGSE).\nNature fascinates me so you’ll often find me with my nose to the ground observing ants or gazing into trees in search of a bird.\nI love to engage in knowledge and experience exchange, not only inside academia but also with the public. So do not hesitate to reach out! Check out my projects and publications and contact me (mbracic192 at gmail dot com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss ideas.\nI firmly believe in open and transparent science, so all my publications are open-access and contain reproducible data and analysis code. To further support open science, I am a member of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology SORTEE, and I encourage you to consider joining this community."

    "text": "Ecological consequences of individual differences in animal “optimism”\nPreprint | Data and code\nWe explored potential ecological consequences of animals being more optimistic or pessimistic (cognitive judgement bias). Considering our main aim, we did not find evidence that optimistic and pessimistic mice make different foraging decisions under predation risk. However, we successfully developed a new test to investigate individual differences in ecologically relevant risk-taking of mice."
