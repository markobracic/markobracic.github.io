# Welcome to my website!

I am a behavioural biologist passionate about understanding how animals make decisions and exploring the ecological consequences of their behaviour. My work is interdisciplinary, incorporating cognition, ecology and evolution with empirical and theoretical approaches to uncover miseries of animal behaviour. I am strongly committed to open science and support the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (SORTEE). 

The nature fascinates me so you'll often find me with my nose to the ground observing ants or gazing into trees in search of a bird.

I love to engage in knowledge and experience exchange, not only inside of academia but also with the public. So do not hesitate to reach out! Check out my projects and publication and [contact me](mailto:mbracic192@gmail.com" ) if you have any questions or would like to discuss ideas.
